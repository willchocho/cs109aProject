Goals:
1) Using all data entries, make a model that can predict the risk of getting Alzheimer's
2) Using only patient data, make a model that can predict the age of getting Alzheimer's
3) Display data in a clear format

Steps:
1) Clean Data
-- NaNs
-- Categorical data
-- Eliminate meaningless data
2) Parse Data
3) Make Model 1
4) Make Model 2
5) Make Website




Observations on Data:
EXAMDATE_bl: First time the person comes to be examined, right after screening
EXAMDATE: Same, or next time the person comes to be examined

Missing data can usually be attributed to loss of contact or death of patient

Group patients together



Checklist:
1) Identified all variables
2) Created variable that indicates whether a patient has ever had Alzheimer's
3)
